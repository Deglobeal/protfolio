            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Be specific and descriptive:</strong> Instead of "Question" 
                use "React Performance Question - Large Component Re-renders"
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Include the type of inquiry:</strong> "Project Inquiry", 
                "Collaboration Request", "Technical Question", etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Keep it concise:</strong> Aim for 50 characters or less 
                to ensure it displays fully on mobile devices
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Avoid spam triggers:</strong> Don't use all caps, excessive 
                punctuation, or words like "URGENT" unless truly necessary
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Make it actionable:</strong> If you need a response by a 
                certain date, include it: "Project Proposal - Response Needed by March 15"

              <li>
                <strong>Suspicious emails:</strong> I don't open suspicious attachments

            <h4>How quickly do you respond to emails?</h4>
            <p>
              I typically respond within 24 hours for business inquiries and within 
              48 hours for general questions. During weekends or holidays, responses 
              may take longer.

            <h4>What if my email ends up in spam?</h4>
            <p>
              If you don't receive a response within 48 hours, your email might have 
              been filtered. Try using the contact form on my website or calling directly 
              for urgent matters.
