          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I am a passionate and dedicated web developer with over 5 years of
            experience in creating innovative digital solutions. My journey in
            technology began during my college years when I discovered the power
            of code to transform ideas into reality.
          </p>

          <p>
            My expertise spans across front-end and back-end development, with a
            particular focus on creating user-centered experiences that are both
            functional and aesthetically pleasing. I believe in the importance
            of clean, maintainable code and collaborative development practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I'm not coding, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects,
            mentoring junior developers, and exploring new technologies that can
            enhance my skill set. I'm also passionate about accessibility and
            ensuring that the web is inclusive for all users.

              problems for real people. Every line of code should serve a
              purpose, and every design decision should be made with the user in
